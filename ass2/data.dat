High One said:
'There is a great deal to be told about this. They took Ymir and carried him into the middle of
Ginnungagap, and made the world from him: from his blood the sea and lakes, from his flesh the earth,
from his bones the mountains; rocks and pebbles they made from his teeth and jaws and those bones
that were broken.'
Just-as-high said:
'From the blood which welled freely from his wounds they fashioned the ocean, when they put together
the earth and girdled it, laying the ocean round about it. To cross it would strike most men as
impossible.'
Third added:
'They also took his skull and made the sky from it and set it over the earth with its four sides, and under
each corner they put a dwarf. These are called: East, West, North, and South. Then they took the sparks
and burning embers that were flying about after they had been blown out of Muspell, and placed them
in the midst of Ginnungagap to give light to heaven above and earth beneath. They gave their stations
to all the stars, some fixed in the sky; others (planets) that had wandered at will in the firmament were
now given their appointed places and the paths in which they were to travel. So it is said in ancient
poems that from that time sprang the reckoning of days and years, as it is said in the Sibyl's Vision:
"The sun did not know where she had her home,
the moon did not know what might he had,
stars did not know where their stations were."
Thus it was before this was done.'
Then Gangleri said:
'Great tidings I'm hearing now. That was a marvellous piece of craftsmanship, and skilfully contrived.
How was the Earth fashioned?'
Then High One answered:
'It is round, and surrounding it lies the deep sea, and on the strand of that sea they gave lands to the
families of giants to settle, but inland they (Bor's sons) built a stronghold round the world on account of
the hostility of the giants; for this stronghold they used Ymir's eyebrows, and they called it Miðgarð.
They took his brains too and flung them up into the air and made from them the clouds, as it is said
here:
"From Ymir's flesh the earth was made
and from his blood the seas,
crags from his bones,
trees from his hair,
and from his skull the sky.
From his eyebrows the blessed gods
made Miðgarð for the sons of men,
and from his brains were created
all storm-threatening clouds."'
Then Gangleri said:
'It seems to me they made great progress when heaven and earth were created and the sun and the stars
given their stations and arrangements made for day and night, but whence came the men who inhabit
the world?'
Then High One answered:
'When they were going along the sea-shore, the sons of Bor found two trees and they picked these up
and created men from them The first gave them spirit and life; the second, understanding and power of
movement; the third, form, speech, hearing, and sight. They gave them clothes and names. The man
was called Ask (ash tree) and the woman Embla; (elm?) and from them have sprung the races of men
who were given Miðgarð to live in. Next they built a stronghold for themselves in the middle of the
world, which is called Asgarð: we call it Troy. There the gods and their kindred lived, and from then on
came to pass many events and memorable happenings both in heaven and earth.'
There is a place there called Hliðskjálf, (hall of many rooms or hall of one big doorway) and when
Óðin sat there on his high seat he saw over the whole world and what everyone was doing and he
understood every-thing he saw. His wife, the daughter of Fjörgvin, was named Frigg, and from that
family has come the kindred that inhabited ancient Asgarð and those kingdoms belonging to it; we call
the members of that family the Æsir and they are all divinities. He (Óðin) may well be called All-father
for this reason - he is the father of all the gods and men and of everything that he and his power
created. The earth was his daughter and his wife; by her he had his first son, Ása-Thór. Might and
strength were Thór’s characteristics, by these he dominates every living creature.'
'There was a giant living in Giantland called Nörfi or Narfi. He had a daughter named Night. She was
dark and swarthy, like the family to which she belonged. Her first marriage was with a man called
Nagifari, their son was called Auð. Next she was married to Annar, their daughter was called Earth.
Last, Delling (shining one) married her, and he was of the family of the gods. Their son was Day, lie
was bright and beautiful like his father's side. Then All-father took Night and her son, Day, and gave
them two horses and two chariots and put them up in the sky, so that they should ride round the world
every twenty-four hours. Night rides first on a horse called Hrímfaxi, (frosty mane) and every morning
