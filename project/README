--------------------Description---------------------

Python HTML scraping program to acquire files from given URL.

How to use the program:

1. Edit config file to choose file types to scrape (default is image formats)
2. python3 scrape.py <url> -f <folder> -q

Additionally, a test program is included demonstrating scrape as an import.

---------------------Arguments----------------------

-q is an optional argument for quiet mode. Quiet mode will suppress any prompts, and continue to run the program.

-f <folder> is an optional argument to specify the folder you wish to download to. Default is ./files.


--------------Additional Information----------------

-If there is an error loading from the config file, the default will be image files.

-Will try to scrape any file type that is set in the config file.

-Be cautious if scraping music or video formats in quiet mode (you wont get asked before downloading).

-Some image locations are not handled, or very badly formed image urls may throw an exception. But almost everything is captured from my experience.
